# 1234. Replace the Substring for Balanced String

## PROBLEM

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-the-substring-for-balanced-string/" %}

```java
class Solution {
    public int balancedString(String s) 
    {
        int start = 0, end = 0, k = s.length() / 4, count = s.length();
        // c: the number of elements outside the window
        int[] c = new int[128];
        for (char ch: s.toCharArray())
        {
            c[ch]++;
        }
        while (end < s.length())
        {
            // we incorporate the element inside our window
            c[s.charAt(end)]--;
            // why do we use "while" and <=: 
            // <=: window + each element's number = s.length()
            // As long as each elements' number is smaller than k
            // and the content in the window can be anything
            // we have gotten one of the solution
            // but we don't know whether it is optimal
            // "while":
            // we want to squeeze window as much as possible
            // if we use "if", we may miss the smallest window after
            // end has reached the end of s
            while (c['Q'] <=  k && c['W'] <=  k && c['E'] <=  k&& c['R'] <=  k)
            {
                // that's for the situation that we don't have to change
                // it is fine that after the while loop, start = end +1
                // since 'end' will increase itself at the bottom
                // but if in the while loop, start > end
                // that means we don't have to change
                // since we cannot have negative window
                // we directly return 0
                if (start > end)
                {
                    return 0;
                }
                count = Math.min(count,end-start+1);
                c[s.charAt(start++)]++;
            }
            end++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## SHORT SUMMARY

* dynamic window size + maximum/minimum + map
* condition for shrinking the window: once every element is smaller or equal to k
  * we can try to shrink the window until we can't
* TC: O(2n) ---> O(n)
* SC: O(1)
