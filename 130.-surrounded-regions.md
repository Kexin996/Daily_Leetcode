        // we use the similar logic in problem #200
        // but this time we have one restriction:
        // if the 'O' of the tree is one any of the four boundaries
        // we don't 'select' it, which means we cannot change it
        
        // how should we do?
        // we need to run dfs on the four boundaries first
        // use '@' to denote the trees that we cannot change to 'X'
        
        // then, we run dfs again on the whole graph.
        // we need to find out the available trees to be replaced.
        // this time we don't need to worry about the boundary cases,
        // since even if there exists a tree connects to the boundary,
        // it will be changed to all '@' in the first running.
        
        // with the ideas in mind, we begin to write down the code.
