            // if not, we need to decide between temporary last element
            // of the increasing array and the pairs
            // for example, we can just substitute the last element
            // of the pairs
            
            // we want our tail as small as possible, and the sorting
            // has already done this for us
            // so we just ignore and continue
        }
