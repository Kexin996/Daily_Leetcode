        int max = 0;

        char[] track = new char[26];
        // we don't need sorting 
        // we need to count the number of most frequent element
        // which is maxcount.
        
        // then, we need to check the available space consisting of
        // the tasks left and idles
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++)
        {

        }
        // what happens if the number of can is bigger than the empty?
        // we don't need to worry about this, since n is only the 
        // least separation between two same letters
        // for example:
        // 4A3B3C2D1E
        // ABCDE/ABCD/ABC/A
        // because the most frequent element
        // is only A
        // other elements' numbers are smaller than the number of 
        // A, we don't need to care about the situation that 
        // whether two same other elements are left, since it contradicts
        // the assumption that A is the most frequent element
        
        // and n is only the least number of separation.
        // in this case we just return tasks.length as the result.
