## PROBLEM

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/" %}

```java
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        int start = 0, end = 0, majority = 0;
        int[] c = new int[26]; // the number of elements inside the window
        while (end < s.length())
        {
            // we don't know the majority of elements in the window
            // so as we meet a new element s.charAt(end)
            // we add it to the map recording the number of elements inside the window
            // if it already exists, we add 1
            // or it will be 1
            c[s.charAt(end)-'A']++;
            
            // then we want to compare the number of s.charAt(end) to the
            // current majority
            majority = Math.max(majority,c[s.charAt(end)-'A']);
            
            // end-start+1: the length of current optimal range
            // end-start+1-majority: the minority that we can flip
            // if it is > k
            // we shirnk the window
            if (end-start+1-majority > k)
            {
                // we decrease the number of start element 
                // as we move the window forward
                c[s.charAt(start)-'A']--;
                // we update the start 
                start++;
            }
            // we update the end
            end++;
            
            /*
            Note: we don't update majority
            so it may be invalud, for example, 'xxxyzz',1
            when end = 4, that is, we meet the first z
            we will shirnk the window, and the number of x becomes 2
            but majority is still 3 ---> will that be a problem?
            
            ans: No
            The majority represents the maximum number of a single element in our window
            unless we meet something like "zzzz", we will update majority
            else, we just keep moving start and end
            the range will not change
            */
        }
        return end-start;
    }
}
```

## SHORT SUMMARY

* sliding window with dynamic range + string ---> we need to use map
* TC: O(n)
* SC: O(1) ---> size of the map is constant as it is a character one
