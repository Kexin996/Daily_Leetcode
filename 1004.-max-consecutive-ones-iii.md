```java
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        // basic sliding window
        /*
        int count = 0, start = 0, zeros = 0;

            {
                zeros++;
            }
            // use a while loop to adjust the range of the window
            while (zeros > k)

## SUMMARY

* it is a dynamic sliding window ---> the window size is decided by the condition: the number of 0' that can be flipped
* basic sliding window:
  * we just keep "shrinking" our window until we find the appropriate range
  * TC: O(n) ---> as in the worst case, the while loop will go over the whole array
    * \[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0], 1 ---> O(2n)
  * SC: O(1)
* improved version:
  * we use a **dynamic memory "window**" to keep track of the range
  * i,j is not the actually length of the window
  * as k >= 0, the window is valid, and we only need to allow j to increase
  * as k < 0, both i,j increase ---> we just use the original range
