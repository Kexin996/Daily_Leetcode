```java
class Solution {
    public int longestOnes(int[] nums, int k) {
        // basic sliding window
        /*
        int count = 0, start = 0, zeros = 0; // zeros: the number of zeros in the window
        for (int end = 0; end < nums.length;end++)
        {
            if (nums[end] == 0)
            {
                zeros++;
            }
            // use a while loop to adjust the range of the window
            while (zeros > k)
            {
                if (nums[start] == 0)
                {
                    zeros--;

            count = Math.max(end-start+1,count);
        }
        return count;
        */
        // improved version
        // by using a dynamic memory 
        int i = 0,j = 0; // k: the number of 0s available in the window
        // i,j: the optimal, maximum range of window fulfilling the requirement 
        while (j < nums.length)
        {
            if (nums[j] == 0)
            {
                k--;
            }
            // now we don't have enough k
            // so our range doesn't change
            if (k < 0)
            {
                // we update the conditon of the dynamic window
                if (nums[i] == 0)
                {
                    k++;
                }
                // i++, j++ ---> samw range
                i++;
                
            }
            j++;
            
        }
        return j-i;
    }
}

## SUMMARY

* it is a dynamic sliding window ---> the window size is decided by the condition: the number of 0' that can be flipped
* basic sliding window:
  * we just keep "shrinking" our window until we find the appropriate range
  * TC: O(n) ---> as in the worst case, the while loop will go over the whole array
    * \[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0], 1 ---> O(2n)
  * SC: O(1)
* improved version:
  * we use a **dynamic memory "window**" to keep track of the range
  * i,j is not the actually length of the window
  * as k >= 0, the window is valid, and we only need to allow j to increase
  * as k < 0, both i,j increase ---> we just use the original range
