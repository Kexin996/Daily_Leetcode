## PROBLEM

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-substrings-containing-all-three-characters/" %}

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int start = 0, end = 0, count = 0;
        int[] c = new int[3];
        while (end < s.length())
        {
            c[s.charAt(end)-'a']++;
            
            // that is the inverse of 'at most'
            // but the goal is the same:
            // we want to count as much as subarrays as possible
            
            // for at most, we find to find all the subarrays <= limit
            // the break point: > limit
            // the appending direction is from the right
            // since we count starting from 1 element
            
            // for at least, we need to find all the subarrays 
            // fulfilling >= limit
            // the break point: < limit
            // the appending direction is from the left
            // since we count starting at all the three elements exist
            while(c[0] > 0 && c[1] > 0 && c[2] > 0)
            {
                c[s.charAt(start++)-'a']--;
            }
            count+= start;
            end++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## SHORT SUMMARY

* dynamic window size + count + at least
* TC: O(n)
* SC: O(1)
