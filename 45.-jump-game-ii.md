# 45. Jump Game II

```java
// TC: O(n) - one way to simplify dp is to use some variables to denote
// the current interval
// SC: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) 
    {
        // distance: the farthest distance we can jump
        // in the current interval
        int distance = 0;
        int count = 0;
        // since we're not sure whether we should jump
        // we need the variable "end" to check the jumping interval 
        // for example, if end = 6, that means the current interval
        // ends at 6
        int end = 0;
        // why do we use nums.length-1 as the ending point:
        // 1. we can avoid the case where the length of the array = 1
        // 2. for nums[nums.length-1], the game ends,
        // we don't need to do any jump; we have
        // already arrived at the end of the array.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length-1; i++)
        {
            // we use distance to track the longest distance
            // before we reach the ending point of the interval
            distance = Math.max(distance,nums[i]+i);
            
            // if we have reached the end of the interval, 
            // we just update the ending point of the new interval.
            // since we move to a new interval, we increase our jump times.
            
            if (i == begin)
            {
                // what happens if distance is already >= nums.length-1?
                // we will never reach nums.length-1, which means we will
                // never update our interval times when we can reach the end.
                
                // the for loop has already considered the case
                // when the distance == nums.length-1.
                begin = distance;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
